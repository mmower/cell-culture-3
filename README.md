# cell-culture-1

I'm reading **Complexity** by M. Mitchell Waldrop and was intrigued by his description of a very early experiment
in cellular automata by Chris Langton and then Conway's Game of Life. I've probably done it several times before but
decided to reimplement Life using the same cellculture JS library I developed for Langton's automata.

It currently uses a simple randomised starting point. Watch [life here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/mmower/cell-culture-3/blob/master/src/cell_culture_3/index.html)
